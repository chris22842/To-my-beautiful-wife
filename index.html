          <p>To my darling wife,
Happy one year anniversary! Can you believe we hit one year of marriage? Looking back it's not hard to believe considering we've been together a long time now, but a year of marriage is still impressive. Still I'd like to say how grateful I am that you said "yes" to marrying me and how happy I've been with you this past year. There's not a day that goes by that I'm not reminded of how lucky I am to be with you, whether we are watching movies, parallel playing on the couch, or we are on a random date. I've loved you for over a decade and that love keeps growing exponentially! ‚ù§Ô∏è üìà 
Are adventures together have been amazing, From vacationing with your parentsüòÇü§Æ in Orlando and California and having to sneak our "love" from them to now being married and on this cruise boat we have grown so much and to think this is just the beginning of our lives gives me they joy I never knew I'd have‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I have always dreamt of us sailing into the sunset together (figuratively) and to get to do that with you literally is a dream come true. I love you for the woman you were for the confident, amazing, strong, sexy, and fit woman you've become ‚ù§Ô∏è 
I WILL NEVER STOP LOVING YOU YAMILETH ‚ù§Ô∏è 


FYI this was super hard to code and I learned more about coding than I thought I wouldüòí i hope everything looks goodüòÖ
